Paste the weights folder from the above repo in our project as models folder in public folder.

We will put the canvas on the image or video. 
The drawings/text made by face-api will be made on this canvas.


For real time i.e video from webcam we will get the video using the <video> tag. And we will put the canvas
on the video element to draw the text and outlines by face-api.js
